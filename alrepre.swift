/// This modifier behaves like ``View/background(_:in:fillStyle:)``,
/// allowing you to set a background for a view using a specified shape and fill style.
/// 
/// - Parameters:
///   - content: The view to use as the background. This can be any view that conforms to the `View` protocol.
///   - shape: The shape in which to clip the background content. Must conform to the `Shape` protocol.
///   - fillStyle: The fill style to use when rendering the shape. Defaults to `.init()`.
/// 
/// - Returns: A view that uses the specified background content, clipped to the given shape, with the specified fill style.
///
/// - Note: This modifier is useful for adding custom backgrounds to views, providing more flexibility than using a simple color or image.
